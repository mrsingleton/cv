# Instructional Tech & Tech Instruction

## Summary
Information Design is a key part of all my work. By day, I run NYU Web Publishing where I focus on usability and information architecture in course sites. By night, I teach interactive content development at CUNY's Grad School of Journalism, where a big focus is on experience design.

## Background
Much of my experience is in web development and site management. Prior to my work managing web services in higher ed, I worked on the web teams at a major news site and at a museum, plus I did project management for a web design firm â€” always with a focus on interaction and information design.

## Expertise
I oversee customer experience and client support for my service, so I know firsthand what real people find intuitive. I'm also overseeing our accessibility overhaul so I work at the strategy and change management level as well.
